Welcome to *Intermediate Algebra,* an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.

### About OpenStax

OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. Our adaptive learning technology, designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized educational paths, is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.

### About *Intermediate Algebra*

*Intermediate Algebra* is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of a one-semester Intermediate algebra course. The book’s organization makes it easy to adapt to a variety of course syllabi. The text expands on the fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.

#### Coverage and Scope

*Intermediate Algebra* continues the philosophies and pedagogical features of *Prealgebra* and *Elementary Algebra*, by Lynn Marecek and MaryAnne Anthony-Smith. By introducing the concepts and vocabulary of algebra in a nurturing, non-threatening environment while also addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles, the book helps students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course and become successful college students.

The material is presented as a sequence of small, and clear steps to conceptual understanding. The order of topics was carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression throughout the course and to facilitate a thorough understanding of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.

* **Chapter 1: Foundations**
  * * *

All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the **Table of Contents**.

#### Key Features and Boxes

**Examples** Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple examples for each learning objective to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.

All examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select examples), we show students how to check the solution. Most examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.

**Be Prepared!** Each section, beginning with Section 2.1, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can determine if they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from previous sections so students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be found in the supplemental resources that accompany this title.

<span data-type="title">Try It</span>

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id11714388" data-alt="try-it"> ![try-it](../resources/tryit.png) </span>**Try it** The Try It feature includes a pair of exercises that immediately follow an Example, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem with an easy reference to the example. In the Web View version of the text, students can click an Answer link directly below the question to check their understanding. In the PDF, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.

<span data-type="title">How To</span>

<span data-type="media" data-alt="how-to"> ![how-to](../resources/howtoicon.png) </span>**How To Examples** use a three column format to demonstrate how to solve an example with a certain procedure. The first column states the formal step, the second column is in words as the teacher would explain the process, and then the third column is the actual math. A How To procedure box follows each of these How To examples and summarizes the series of steps from the example. These procedure boxes provide an easy reference for students.

<span data-type="title">Media</span>

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1176044388" data-alt="Media"> ![Media](../resources/media.png) </span>**Media** The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Self Check. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany *Intermediate Algebra*.

**Self Check** The Self Check includes the learning objectives for the section so that students can self-assess their mastery and make concrete plans to improve.

#### Art Program

*Intermediate Algebra* contains many figures and illustrations. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions.

 <span data-type="media" data-alt="This figure shows three x y-coordinate planes. The first plane shows two lines which intersect at one point. Under the graph it says, &#x201C;The lines intersect. Intersecting lines have one point in common. There is one solution to this system.&#x201D; The second x y-coordinate plane shows two parallel lines. Under the graph it says, &#x201C;The lines are parallel. Parallel lines have no points in common. There is no solution to this system.&#x201D; The third x y-coordinate plane shows one line. Under the graph it says, &#x201C;Both equations give the same line. Because we have just one line, there are infinitely many solutions.&#x201D;"> ![This figure shows three x y-coordinate planes.
